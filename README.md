Image Classification with Convolutional Auto Encoder.

Original dataset is much larger but due to poor hardware I used the 11 of 770 MB dataset. So you can download the original dataset from Kaggle's website by searching Cats-Dogs and train your model on that data if your hardware is capable of so that your accuracy may be higher and your model may be much better than that.
